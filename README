MFC - Math Fun with C
A C program intended to implement some maths so that 
it may be inspeceted as assembly.  Will be playing with
BitInt implementation, prime finding, and maybe even
do some concurrency opperations to experiment with
concurency.  This is to support at least one of two
directions I want take; to develop on the Sega Genisis
to understand it's programming paradigm and CUDA
programming to get into developing neural nets from
scratch.
